## Issues

1. Don’t add magic numbers - [FIXED]
2. Should use input signal instead of decorator
3. Centralize all colours, don’t just use them willy-nilly - [FIXED]
4. Move quiz-results logic to quiz service also. Scoring criteria should also be picked from quiz json - [FIXED]
5. Maybe I can enforce an interface and make different types of quiz follow it?
6. Mostly all the first option is the correct answer, need to change it
7. For all blank questions, transliterations should have complete sentences 
8. The reordering story quiz is not working properly I think
9. Centralize all fonts - [FIXED]
10. Move all references of Punjabi to config `Punjabi.ts`. So later, I can create a `Hindi.ts` and my application becomes a Hindi Reading app when I want. Similarly, I can do for any language - [FIXED]
